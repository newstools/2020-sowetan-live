President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation about the Covid-19 state of disaster at 8pm on Saturday. Ramaphosa's spokesperson, Tyrone Seale, said the address followed a meeting of the national coronavirus command council earlier in the week and meetings of the president’s co-ordinating council and cabinet on Saturday. There has been widespread speculation that as various Covid-19 graphs head downwards following the peak in the local pandemic towards the end of July, Ramapohosa will ease the lockdown from alert level 3 to level 2, allowing the economy to get back into full swing. Seale's brief statement said: “President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation at 20h00 this evening, Saturday 15 August 2020, on developments in South Africa’s risk-adjusted strategy to manage the spread of Covid-19. “The president’s address will be broadcast live on television and radio and will be streamed live on a range of online platforms.” TimesLIVE understands that the Covid-19 state of disaster, which ends on Saturday, will be extended with the publication of a government gazette before the president's address. This is a developing story. TimesLIVE
