Ntando Duma is having quite the year, having recently joined one of television's biggest telenovelas, The Queen. Known for serving sauce on the 'gram, the actress took things up a notch when she revealed her more sultry side in a glamorous event to usher in her 25th birthday. The starlet made sure to celebrate her quarter of a century in style this weekend when she hosted a black tie, star studded dinner. Duma looked flawless in a floor-length red dress by LSL Designs. Guests included political bigwig, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, DJ Shimza, actress Nadia Japhta and other close friends. Here is a look at some of the pictures from her celebration!
