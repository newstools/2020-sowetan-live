Applications for the second wave of Covid-19 relief funding for athletes have opened and will close at the end on the final day of August‚ the sport‚ arts and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa announced in Pretoria on Monday. Athletes will have between August 18 to August 31 to apply and the maximum amount of relief available per applicant is set at R6‚600.

Athletes who benefitted from the previous funds do not qualify for the second wave. “Note that a list of all sport beneficiaries who benefited during the first wave will be posted on the various department platforms and also be given to Federations and sports entities to guard against any form of double dipping‚” said Mthethwa. The minister said his department will be rolling-out two processes to implement sector relief. The first process will include relief for athletes and all technical personnel in the sport sector while the second will focus on arts and culture sector relief. Applicants who are eligible to apply will include athletes‚ coaches‚ technical support personnel and freelance fitness instructors or practitioners. “These are applicants who rely solely on income generated from participating in sport competitions‚ events and in fitness activities‚ who operate as freelancers‚” said Mthethwa.

They are encouraged to explore other relief interventions available within government‚ particularly the Department of Employment and Labour. ∙ Sport personnel with other sources of income and those who are employed or on a fixed term contract do not qualify for relief. Athletes on fixed-term contracts: These athletes are catered for in terms of contracts entered into with either the federations or clubs. ∙ Sport personnel who benefited from the first wave of relief or from any of the provincial relief funds do not qualify. “It is critical to note that any provision of false information will be treated as fraud and dealt with through the appropriate criminal justice system‚” said Mthethwa.
