A man in his 50s who raped a child in a Graaff Reinet cemetery has been served a 15-year prison sentence. Pieter Jaftha took the girl, aged seven, from her home in Santaville in September last year to the graveyard where he raped her, police said in a statement. He remained in custody throughout the trial in the Grahamstown high court. Eastern Cape police commissioner Lt-Gen Liziwe Ntshinga commended the investigating team and the prosecution. She said: “The sentence is the outcome of the SAPS' unwavering commitment in the fight against crimes against women and children and gender-based violence and hard work of the investigation officer and other specialised disciplines of the SAPS together with the NPA.” TimesLIVE
