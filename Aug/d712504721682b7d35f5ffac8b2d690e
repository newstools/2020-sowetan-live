Essential personal protective equipment (PPE) meant to safeguard health-care workers and curb the spread of Covid-19 in the country,  was found floating in a river in Centurion on Sunday. Gauteng acting MEC for health Jacob Mamabolo confirmed the PPE was found floating in a river at the Irene Country Club. Mamabolo said a criminal case had been opened. Gauteng police could not immediately confirm whether a case had been opened. The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) said it was “unacceptable that PPE, which is needed by front-line workers to protect themselves and save the lives of our people, are dumped in a river. “In the video one can see gloves and masks, which are in short supply in health-care facilities across the country.” TimesLIVE
