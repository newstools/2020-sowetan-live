The US Treasury said on Friday it has not identified any foreign financial institution “that has knowingly conducted a significant transaction” since October 14 with individuals deemed responsible for China's crackdown in Hong Kong. The Treasury assessment was required under a State Department report in October that put international banks on notice that they would face sanctions if they were found to be doing business with US-blacklisted officials in Hong Kong.
