The SA Revenue Service (Sars) will be instituting a two-week lockdown of its offices  because of concerns over the rise in Covid-19 cases. The closure, between  December 24 and  January 4, is intended to curb potential   infections among taxpayers and the agency’s staff, Sars said on Tuesday. Branches  will operate remotely via digital channels and existing in-branch appointments will be honoured, it said. All new bookings made  on the Sars website will be honoured by a virtual appointment via  Microsoft Teams or via phone, and the Sars call centre will remain open. All SA border posts manned by Sars customs officials will  operate during the lockdown, it said, with strict social-distancing and hygiene protocols in place. “We will review this decision and communicate in advance should we decide to extend this arrangement,” the agency said. Last week, health minister Zweli Mkhize announced that a fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus has been detected in SA and  found in hotspots  in provinces such as the Eastern Cape. The pandemic’s first wave and the nationwide lockdown earlier in the year has had a devastating effect on revenue collections, intensifying difficulties for SA’s already weak fiscus. Tax revenues are expected to come in almost R313bn below what was forecast in the 2020 budget. BusinessLIVE
