The minister of transport has extended the grace period to renew expired driving licences until August 31 2021, due to bottlenecks caused by the Covid-19 lockdown. On December 3 Fikile Mbalula gazetted an amendment to the lockdown regulations stating that all learner's licences, driving licence cards, temporary driving licences and professional driving permits that expire between March 26 and December 31 2020 are deemed to be valid, and their validity periods have been extended until  August 31 2021. Initially the grace period had been extended to January 31 2021, but the further seven-month grace period was implemented after  a continued backlog of licence renewals. Many people have struggled to renew their expired licences, either on Gauteng's online booking systemÂ https://online.natis.gov.za or in walk-in bookings in other provinces. The extension won't apply to licences which expire from January 1 2021, and motorists are urged to apply for a new card several weeks before it actually expires. The extension also does not apply to vehicle licences. If the licence disc expired before or during lockdown, penalties will apply when you renew it. In November Mbalula made an unannounced visit to Themba Driving Licence Testing Centre (DLTC) in Hammanskraal, after  outrage from drivers and vehicle owners who were frustrated at  the  backlog in the online booking system. The minister acknowledged the challenge of corruption at DLTCs nationwide and committed himself to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book. On November 12 he announced the following interventions to ease the backlog: Anyone with information on fraud and corruption  at driving licence testing centres can report such activities to 0861 400 800.
