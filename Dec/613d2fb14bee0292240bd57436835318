The Bakubung ba Ratheo traditional community has welcomed a high court judgment which suspended North West premier Job Mokgoro's decision to appoint an administrator for the community. The premier had made the decision, effective from December 1, to appoint Moatlhodi Dilotsotlhe as administrator. Some of Dilotsotlhe's duties included  investigations into the financial affairs of the community and its commercial and economic vehicles. The decision by Mokgoro came after the community pleaded poverty in June as regular dividend flows from its R500m investment in financial advisory firm Musa Group dried up. The 30,000-strong Bakubung ba Ratheo's land, near Rustenburg, sits on top of  substantial platinum deposits. The community applied to the North West high court to interdict and suspend the implementation of the decision of Mokgoro to place the community under administration and the appointment of an administrator. The matter was heard on December 18 and the court passed judgment last Tuesday. According to the court order, Mokgoro's decision to appoint an administrator for the community is interdicted and suspended. The administrator is also interdicted and restrained from administering the affairs of the community, pending the final determination of the application instituted by the community and its chief Solomon Monnakgotla to review and set aside the premier’s decision. "The office of Kgosi and the Bakubung ba Ratheo community are delighted with but unsurprised at the court’s decision as the North West government’s decision to place the community council under administration violates the very prescripts and essence of the constitution and is improper, invalid and inappropriate," the community said  on Monday.
