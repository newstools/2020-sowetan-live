Wentworth and Merebank residents want the Engen refinery to compensate families  who “lost everything” in last week's explosion at the plant south of Durban. On Wednesday, hundreds of protesters gathered in Tara Road to demand  all residents and workers affected by the blast be adequately compensated. South Durban Community Environmental Alliance air quality and officer Bongani Mthembu told SowetanLIVE's sister publication TimesLIVE  “enough was enough” as Engen's history of gas leaks and explosions, which affected the Merebank, Wentworth and Bluff communities, were well-documented. “We want Engen refinery's senior leadership to make themselves accountable for the damage caused by the explosion on December 4, and many other incidents that have happened in the plant before,” he said. “All residents and workers in the south Durban basin who have been affected by the most recent blast must be adequately compensated for damages both materially and psychologically.” At least seven people were treated for smoke inhalation after the explosion and subsequent fire at the Engen  refinery  on Friday. Mthembu said several residents had lost their homes. “Engen has put them up in a B&B for just five days. That on its own is a problem. They have lost everything. What happens after five days?” He said beyond the immediate relief sought, residents demanded  Engen subject itself to a full independent review of its operations and the effects  on the health and wellbeing  of adjacent communities. The protesters are expected to hand  their demands to Engen later on Wednesday. Engen management, who were called to account for the explosion before parliament on Tuesday, could not be reached for comment. Yusa Hassan, Engen MD and chairperson, told the committee Engen was compliant and operating within the acceptable limits. He said there was insufficient information to explain the cause of the blast before investigations were completed. TimesLIVE
