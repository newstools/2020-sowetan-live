Denmark has confirmed its first coronavirus infection in a man who recently returned from a ski holiday in the Lombardy region in northern Italy, the Danish Health Authority said on Thursday. After testing positive on Wednesday night, the man was put in isolation in his own home together with his wife and son, who both tested negative for the virus. “We are taking the new situation very seriously. The work of containing and tracing has begun,” Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said in a statement. The case will not change the country's current risk assessment, published on Tuesday, which finds a low risk of a countrywide epidemic, the Danish Health Authority said, but added it expected more cases of infection in Denmark.
