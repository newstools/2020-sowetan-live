Telkom on Tuesday acknowledged an interruption and fault in its network was affecting  clients across the country, notably major corporates' toll-free numbers. Openserve, a division of Telkom, said its high-level support personnel were   working with its vendor technical support teams to isolate and resolve a fault that is  affecting voice services. “Current indications are the fault is impacting the flow of data through the gateway to Openserve’s hosted voice environment.” Pynee Chetty, Openserve spokesperson, said wholesale voice clients and their customers have been affected since 7am on Tuesday, “with intermittent call termination failures”. “Openserve apologises to its clients for the inconvenience this has caused, and assures them that its centre operations team is  handling the matter as a  priority failure. The team is committed to doing everything it possibly can to fully restore voice services in the shortest time possible,” Chetty said. Discovery, Standard Bank and Absa were among the companies affected, and were advising clients that its call centres were unavailable and directing customers to other platforms, including their websites and apps.
