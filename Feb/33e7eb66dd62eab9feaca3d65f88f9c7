Tshwane metro police  on Friday impounded a minibus taxi  carrying 29 pupils on  the Mabopane highway near Block XX. They  said the taxi operator was not in possession of a driving licence. The taxi owner was also fined for allowing the taxi driver to operate without proper documents. TMPD chief Lt-Gen Johanna Nkomo condemned this behaviour and said the department would work hard to clamp down on lawlessness on the city's roads. The department also advised parents to check how their children are transported to school.
