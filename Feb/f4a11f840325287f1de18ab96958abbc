Bedevilled power producer Eskom – which is trying to bleed as much as R190bn from consumers through a series of tariff hikes – has been dealt a hammer blow by the Pretoria High Court. On Monday, judge Jody Kollapen dismissed an urgent application by the utility, which if successful would have seen electricity prices raised by 16.6% and 16.7% over the next two years.
