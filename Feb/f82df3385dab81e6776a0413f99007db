Fifteen-year-old Nikita Pearl Waligwa died on Saturday, after suffering from a brain tumor, according to the school she attended in Uganda. "Fare thee well Nikita Pearl Waligwa. You were a darling to many and we have lost you to brain tumor at such a tender age," the tweet from Gayaza High School said. "Rest in Perfect Peace dear."

The stars  took to social media to express their sadness and condolences on the passing of the young actress. “We mourn the loss of our beautiful Nikita Pearl Waligwa. She was a ball of light in @queenofkatwemovie and in life. Her battle with a brain tumor was humbling to witness. Her light will live on,” Olyelowo posted.
