London police on Saturday charged a 29-year-old homeless man with causing grievous bodily harm and possessing an illegal knife he used to stab a mosque leader during prayers. Suspect Daniel Horton stabbed London Central Mosque's muazzin Raafat Maglad during daily prayers on Thursday. London police quickly ruled out a terror motive. Maglad was treated at a London hospital and returned to the mosque for Friday's evening service with his arm wrapped in a sling. "I forgive him. I feel very sorry for him," Maglad told reporters on Friday. "To me, as a Muslim, I don't need to put any hatred in my heart." Several regulars at the Regent's Park area mosque in northwest London said they had seen Horton attend a few services in the past year. Horton will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court for a preliminary hearing later Saturday.
