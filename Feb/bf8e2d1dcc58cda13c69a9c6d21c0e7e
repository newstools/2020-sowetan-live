Three suspects, aged between 21 and 47, were arrested on Wednesday. The Hawks worked with the West Rand Tactical Response Team and Eskom. Mulamu said officers observed the operation “for some time.” “Two of the suspects were found processing the gold and were apprehended. The plot owner was also arrested for harbouring people who were operating criminal activities on his premises.” The team seized mining equipment worth about R5m. -TimesLIVE Mulamu said the Hawk’s Priority Crime Specialised Investigation team had been called in to initiate a financial and assets investigation. The three men were expected to appear in the Westonaria magistrate’s court on Thursday. In Limpopo, police have opened an inquest into the deaths of two illegal miners.
