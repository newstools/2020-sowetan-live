Africa's fight against the deadly Covid-19 was given yet another boost by Chinese billionaire businessmanÂ Jack Ma, who announced a second donation of health-care equipment to African states. This comes a few weeks after the Alibaba founder announced his foundation and the Alibaba Foundation would donate equipment to African countries to help them fight the Covid-19 pandemic which has claimed thousands of lives. Similar donations were made to Latin America, Asia and the US. In a tweet on Monday, Ma announced the donation of 500 ventilators, 200,000 suits and face shields, 2,000 thermometers, a million swabs and extraction kits and 500,000 gloves to all 54 African countries.
