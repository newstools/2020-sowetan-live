The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) in KwaZulu-Natal has called on those in dire need to apply for relief in the form of food parcels as a temporary means to avert hunger during lockdown. KZN Sassa spokesperson Sandy Godlwana outlined which households are eligible: "There is a lot of fake news circulating about who qualifies and how to get help. Unfortunately these fake messages have incorrect details for the Sassa call centres," said Godlwana. Due to challenges to get through to the Sassa national toll-free number, the agency has dedicated two contact numbers for those seeking social relief: "An appeal is made to everyone who might know of someone in dire need of help Â to not hesitate but approach Sassa," added Godlwana. Those who are eligible for food parcels will have to provide their name, identity number, physical address, contact number and a short reason for their request.
