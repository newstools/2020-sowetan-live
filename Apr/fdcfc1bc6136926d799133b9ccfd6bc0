During SA's coronavirus lockdown, we are still printing and distributing the Sowetan newspaper every weekday as usual. However, there have been inevitable interruptions in our efforts to deliver to all the usual shops and other sellers. Here's the good news: you can still read our April 15 edition online. Click below to page through the edition or zoom in for easy reading. (On desktop, you can click the icon in the bottom right corner to expand your view to full screen.) Articles from the newspaper are still published digitally on the SowetanLIVE website too, of course.
