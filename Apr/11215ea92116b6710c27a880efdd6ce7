An administration block at a Soshanguve secondary school was ravaged by an  apparent explosion and  fire on Monday morning. The Gauteng education department confirmed the incident at Amogelang Secondary School in Soshanguve. MEC Panyaza Lesufi said members of the community said they  heard a loud bang which sounded like an explosion  coming from the school. Subsequently,  a fire broke out in the administration block. “Fire fighters attended the scene and managed to extinguish the fire. Unfortunately the administration block was burnt down. Sadly, there was nothing to salvage from this unfortunate incident. “The fire destroyed files, photocopy machines, computers, printers and other items. Fortunately, nutrition and learners' scripts were stored elsewhere,” Lesufi said. The  extent of the loss is still to be determined. The fire department has launched an investigation to determine the cause of fire. Police were also on scene and are investigating. “ It looks like this was a break-in because some of the locks and doors were broken. “We  appeal to anyone who might have information on this unfortunate act to share it  with the police. It is disappointing that yet another school has been destroyed by fire,” Lesufi said.
