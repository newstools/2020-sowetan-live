Experienced forward Thokozani Sekotlong hopes to enjoy some stability in his career now that he has joined Chippa United. The 28-year-old striker has played for a number of teams in the Absa Premiership, including Mamelodi Sundowns, Black Leopards, Maritzburg United and Free State Stars. He also played in second-tier for Cape Town All Stars. However, the striker hopes to have a longer and more meaningful stay at the Port Elizabeth-based Chippa United. "My journey in the PSL has been pretty interesting but fruitful," Sekotlong said. "I have had my ups and downs and I guess that comes with football because there was a stage that I was with Sundowns, one of the biggest teams at the moment. "I've had a good journey and I have learnt a lot, living in different cities. But obviously it's not something one would wish for. As a footballer, you want stability at a certain stage in your life. "That's the ideal dream of any footballer to be in a good team and be there for a long time because you are stable. "I have not yet had that luxury and I hope Chippa will be that team," he said. Sekotlong joined the Chilli Boys in January after spending the first half of the season without a team. He has made only six appearances for the Chilli Boys. "I haven't really got much game time as I would like in order to make a big impact. With more game time I will achieve that because I know what I am capable of. "I feel like I still have a lot to prove and a lot to show. I still have a long journey to prove myself. I am willing to put in the work and turn things around and help the team get into the top eight. "I believe that Chippa has so much potential and I am at a really good team. "I believe the coach that is there right now can take the team to another level."
