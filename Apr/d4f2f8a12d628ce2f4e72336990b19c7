The store was closed immediately and a professional decontamination company has been brought in to sanitise and deep clean.” The group said the store would be reopened in consultation with the provincial department of health. “An employee screening programme supported by the company’s mobile clinic has been put into place. Those employees who had close contact with the infected person are now self-quarantining for 14 days,” the statement read.
