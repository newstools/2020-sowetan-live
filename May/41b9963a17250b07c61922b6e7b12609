Durban port health authorities are waiting for the Covid-19 test results for a crewman aboard a bulk vehicle carrier before allowing the vessel  to dock. National Sea Rescue Institute Durban station commander Jonathan Kellerman said a team transported a doctor to the vessel which is anchored off the coast of Durban. "Port health authorities had arranged for the doctor to take sample swabs from a crewman onboard the ship for Covid-19 laboratory testing prior to the ship being granted permission to enter port," he said. The doctor was transferred to the ship from a sea rescue craft to collect sample swabs from the crewman. "Port health authorities will evaluate the samples to determine safe passage for the ship to enter port," said Kellerman.
