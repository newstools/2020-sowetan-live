A media briefing by minister Lindiwe Sisulu on corruption at the water and sanitation department was rocked by apparent “Zoom-bombing” on Wednesday. The user insulted the ANC government and criticised its apparent non-action on corruption. Midway through the briefing, the faceless user logged in and first displayed a placard on which was written “f**k the ANC”. A few seconds later, the hacker showed another placard with the words “number of people jailed for corruption under [president Cyril] Ramaphosa = 0", with the zero circled around the president's face. The hacker's final act before the Zoom feed was cut off was to post a Photoshopped picture of Ramaphosa with a clownish appearance. The media briefing continued without the Zoom feed where other water and sanitation officials had joined in.
