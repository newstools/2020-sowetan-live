No, you cannot visit your family under level 3 of the lockdown. Police minister Bheki Cele was emphatic on Thursday - social visits are not allowed come June 1.

Social visits are absolutely not allowed under level 3. I hope that question is well answered.” He was speaking after minister in the presidency Jackson Mthembu, who was chairing the briefing, seemed to say that such visits were allowed.

I think what my colleagues have said, ultimately, we must all adapt to these times. It cannot only be a government regulation and government directions that will guide our behaviour,” he said. Regulation 33 states that people may move about under the following conditions:
