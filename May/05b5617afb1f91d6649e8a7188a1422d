Abel Moffat Sithole has been appointed as the new CEO of the Public Investment Corporation (PIC). Sithole is currently the commissioner of the Financial Sector Conduct Authority and the principal executive officer at the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF). Apart from the CEO post, he will also be the executive director on the PIC board. Both positions are for five years.
