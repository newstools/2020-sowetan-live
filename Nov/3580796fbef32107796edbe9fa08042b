Lockdown has coincided with an increase in teenage pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa, where 1 million  pregnant teens face difficulties in returning to school. According to World Vision, a humanitarian aid organisation, teenage pregnancy  spiked during the Covid-19 crisis, and is now is threatening to bar   1 million girls across sub-Saharan Africa from returning to school. In a study titled “Covid-19 Aftershock: Access Denied”, the organisation says the pandemic caused “additional and unanticipated disruption”. “School closures during crises can result in girls spending more time with men and boys than they would were they   in school, leading to greater likelihood of engagement in risky sexual behaviour and increased risk of sexual violence exploitation.” For more on this article, please visit DispatchLIVE.
