Police received a tip-off about corruption at the Lengaung Testing Centre in Bloemfontein, and began their investigation. “Between October 22, 2019, and June 22, 2020, an undercover agent approached the testing officials to help with the change of ownership, roadworthy certificates, police clearance and renewal of licence discs in exchange for cash. “Lekale, a police officer based at Lengau Traffic Centre, allegedly issued police clearance certificates without proper examination being done on the vehicles. Traffic officials allegedly facilitated the issuing of roadworthy certificates and registration of vehicles without the vehicle being present at the centre. “They received amounts ranging from R200 to R8,000. The total amount they received is estimated at R68,800,” said Shuping. The case was postponed to January 19. TimesLIVE
