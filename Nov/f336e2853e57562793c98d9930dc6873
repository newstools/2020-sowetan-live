Nigeria will sanction CNN for the U.S. news organisation's report that the country's military shot and killed protesters demonstrating against police brutality, a minister said on Thursday. The broadcaster used "unverified and possibly doctored videos" and "information from questionable sources" in its report, said Lai Mohammed, Nigeria's information minister, at a news conference in Abuja.
