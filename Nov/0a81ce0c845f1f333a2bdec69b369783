The national taxi alliance said they would not be “taken for a ride “ by a “small boy” -referring to transport minister Fikile Mbalula. The alliance marched from the Putco depot at Marabastad taxi rank in Pretoria through the National Department of Transportation, ending at the Union Buildings. A memorandum with a list of grievances and demands was handed over to both the minister and  President Cyril Ramaphosa. The main grievance was the Covid-19 relief fund for taxi operators still being outstanding. The national taxi alliance urged Mbalula to “pay the money” or action would follow. They demand a written response from both the president and the minister within 14 days. TimesLIVE
