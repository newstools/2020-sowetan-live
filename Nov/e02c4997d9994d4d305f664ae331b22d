Damaging hail, potentially destructive wind and localised flooding could be on the way as a storm hits Gauteng, the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga on Thursday. The SA Weather Service issued a warning on Wednesday ahead of the expected inclement weather. Meanwhile, Eskom said it was attending to major outages in Gauteng as people around the province were experiencing  extended power interruption  caused by multiple network faults associated with storms. Affected areas included Lanseria, Morningside, Muldersdrift, Paulshof, Petervale, Soweto and Zandspruit. “Because of high call volumes, it may take a prolonged time to completely clear the backlog and restore supply to all affected customers.  Eskom recovery teams are working around the clock  repairing  faults and damage to restore supply to affected areas,” Eskom said in a statement. For safety reasons, Eskom urged customers to treat all electricity points as live at all times. Eskom said its contact centre was  experiencing high call volumes and encouraged customers to use other channels such as the SMS line or the Eskom app to log faults. TimesLIVE
