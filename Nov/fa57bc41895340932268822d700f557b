Nowa Makula, 32 - the man accused of hacking six members of a family in Elliotdale, in the Eastern Cape, to death last week - will make a formal bail application on December 7. Makula was the boyfriend of the mother and father of three of the children who were hacked to death with an axe, including a six-month-old baby. The horrific scene was discovered by the mother's 16-year-old son. The killings have made headlines in SA and internationally and came as the country started its 16 Days of Activism against gender-based violence campaign. Makula made his first court appearance in the Elliotdale magistrate's court on Monday before the matter was postponed for the bail application. DispatchLIVE
