SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said the head office, the Gauteng provincial office in Pretoria and its Limpopo office in Polokwane had been closed with immediate effect. Kganyago said the offices would remain close until June 29. “The closure is as a result of one of our members having tested positive for Covid-19. The head of the SIU and the management team will deal with the matter in accordance with the SIU protocols and the regulations from government. “To this effect, it must be noted that the services of the SIU are still available to the public as our employees will be working from home,” he said.
