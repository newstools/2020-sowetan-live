“I want you to learn from my mistakes!” is something many of us have heard before, most likely from our parents. Undoubtedly their words caused great resentment, until we realised they were actually onto something. Parents and close family are often the first role models we have, and their opinions and attitudes guide our early behaviour and decision-making. But as we grow older and find ourselves more independent and exposed to new experiences and ideas, the type of guidance we seek may change. We may look for mentors in other areas of our lives such as education, business and relationships. Many successful business people will point to a line of mentors who’ve played important roles in guiding them to where they are today. They found value in learning from others who had walked similar paths and could give them sage advice, motivation and confidence. They were grateful for the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Join Nwabisa Makunga, editor of Sowetan, in a Sowetan Women’s Club dialogue where she speaks with experts about what mentorship is, the value of being mentored, and how to find a mentor to guide you towards a promising future.
