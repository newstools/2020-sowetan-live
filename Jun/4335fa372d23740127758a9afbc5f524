Barcelona made the first slip in the title race since La Liga's return by drawing 0-0 against Sevilla on Friday and handing Real Madrid the chance to regain top spot this weekend. After their emphatic 3-0 win over Valencia on Thursday, Madrid will move level on points with Barca if they beat Real Sociedad on Sunday and go above the Catalans due to their superior record head-to-head. Sevilla, in third, and Valencia, in eighth, always looked capable of shifting the dynamic at the top of the table, with Madrid capitalising to climb back to the summit for the first time since they beat Barcelona on March 1.
