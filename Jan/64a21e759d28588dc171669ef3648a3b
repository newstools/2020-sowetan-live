Former SA Revenue Service (Sars) executive and retired police colonel Johannes van Loggerenberg will today testify in the commission of inquiry into state capture. The commission yesterday announced that Van Loggerenberg would take the witness stand in the inquiry today. It said Van Loggerenberg will give testimony  related  to law enforcement. Commission spokesperson Reverend Mbuyiselo Stemela confirmed to Sowetan that Van Loggerenberg would be testifying about  his time at the SAPS. Van Loggerenberg is a former Sars official who was accused of being behind the so-called "rogue" unit that allegedly intercepted communications of politicians and spied on the defunct Scorpions and the NPA in 2007. He also made headlines when stories surfaced about his romantic relationship with Belinda Walter, a Pretoria-based lawyer. Walter headed the Fair-Trade Independent Tobacco Association - which represented smaller tobacco firms that frequently had troubles with the tax authorities. Van Loggerenberg  resigned from Sars in 2016 after working at the revenue collector for 16 years.
