Rest easy bro! You were one of the most talented, kind hearted people ever.” In December Radebe shared a lengthy post on Facebook about his battle with the deadly disease. “2019 was the hardest year of my life thus far. I was diagnosed with cancer in late 2018 and began chemotherapy on 14 january 2019…It was the closest to hell I will ever experience. But I grew up in hardship so I handled it. It was a true do or die period,” he wrote. Radebe rose to stardom as a presenter on Yo-TV, he then moved on to play Vusi on Backstage from 1994-2004.
