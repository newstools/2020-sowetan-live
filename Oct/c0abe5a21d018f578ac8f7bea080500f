Nigeria will allow federal government schools to reopen from October 12, while schools run by states and private owners may open on their own timetables, the education minister said on Friday. New COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, have steadily fallen in recent weeks, according to official data. The education minister, Adamu Adamu, said the drop spurred the decision to reopen schools." Since the beginning of September 2020, we have witnessed a considerable decline in the rate of infections," Adamu said in a statement. The October 12 date affects 104 federal institutes known as Unity colleges. The reopening of the rest of Nigeria's schools is determined by state governments. Nigeria has recorded more than 59,000 coronavirus cases and more than 1,100 deaths.
