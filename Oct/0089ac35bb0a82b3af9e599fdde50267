He said the following alternative routes can be used: “Motorists will be informed as soon as the road is open again. We apologise for any inconvenience,” Makhele said. Tensions were high in  Senekal on Friday, as two men arrested in connection with the murder of farm manager Brendin Horner, 21, applied for bail. EFF supporters gathered in the main road threw rocks, bricks and empty beer bottles at a group who attempted to pass. A little earlier, the red berets - carrying golf clubs, sticks and knobkerries - shouted “shoot, shoot, shoot,” towards farmers, bikers and members of community. Police nyalas and armed police officers remained on high alert. TimesLIVE
