The PowerBall Plus jackpot from Tuesday nightâ€™s draw has been won by a player who purchased the winning ticket in East London. The announcement by Ithuba comes a day after the national lottery operator said two Lotto players who each purchased tickets for R20 and selected the winning numbers manually are now both R7m richer. The Lotto Plus 2 jackpot was R14.4m in the October 24 draw, which they will share equally. Three weeks ago, a PowerBall winner in the Free State bagged R121m, the third biggest jackpot win of 2020. The other two previous big winners scooped R135m and R153m in KwaZulu-Natal. TimesLIVE
