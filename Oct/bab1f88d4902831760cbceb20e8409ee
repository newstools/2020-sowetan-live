South Korea on Wednesday proposed allowing abortion up until the fourteenth week of pregnancy as part of a new law designed to comply with a landmark ruling by the constitutional court that struck down a decades-long ban. South Korea criminalised abortion in 1953 when its leaders wanted to boost the population, but exceptions to the law were introduced in 1973, including when the pregnancy was caused by a sexual crime. However, the Constitutional Court overturned the ban in April last year, saying it unconstitutionally curbed women's rights and ordering the government to come up with a new law. Under the new proposal, abortion would be banned after 14 weeks except in the case of a sex crime, or if the health of the mother is at risk, or if the fetus shows signs of severe birth defects, in which case abortion would be allowed up to 24 weeks, the Justice Ministry said in a statement. It also allowed the use of the drug mifepristone for performing abortions. The proposal drew criticism from both sides of the debate, with women's rights groups arguing that the law is still focused on punishing women. Instead, any law should focus on how to safely provide the procedure, the Joint Action for Reproductive Justice in Seoul said in a statement. The Catholic Bishopsâ€™ Conference of Korea issued a statement opposing the justice ministry decision, saying that children should be protected "from the very moment of conception." Ahead of the court's ruling, opinion polls showed around three-quarters of South Koreans supported dropping the ban. South Korea has a fertility rate of 1.1 births per woman, the lowest of 198 countries and falling far behind the global average of 2.4, according to the 2020 United Nations Population Fund report.
