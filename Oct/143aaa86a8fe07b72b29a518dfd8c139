A high profile police officer has been arrested for alleged fraud relating to a multimillion-rand tender for emergency warning equipment. According to the Investigating Directorate (ID), the officer is the 13th accused expected to appear in the Palm Ridge magistrate's court on Monday on charges of corruption, fraud, theft and money laundering. “Her arrest and appearance relate to the supply of emergency warning equipment for the SA Police Service in 2017.
