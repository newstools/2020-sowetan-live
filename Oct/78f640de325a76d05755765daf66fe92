Storms in the Goldfields area of the Free State have led to the collapse of two 132 kV towers on the Everest-Welkom Bulk feeder. This  resulted in a loss of supply to a substantial portion of Welkom since 8pm on Sunday. "Due to the extent of the damage, it is expected that the outage will last for an extended period," Eskom said in a statement. An update will be provided later on Monday once an estimated restoration time has been established. TimesLIVE
