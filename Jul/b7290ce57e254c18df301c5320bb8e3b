From the townships of SA to the world, Amapiano is headed for global domination one TikTok video at a time. According to latest data by the world's leading short-form mobile video platform, South Africans are not the only ones that can't get enough of 'Yanos - but the world is also starting to listen. This week #Amapiano exploded to over 73-million views on TikTok.

The duo's other collaborations Lorch, Emcimbini, Love You Tonight, Nana Thula and Indaba Kabani have also gained big traction. "When a song trends on TikTok, there is a direct correlation with the song doing well on other streaming charts on other platforms," explains Boniswa Sidwaba, TikTok content operations manager for Africa. "It is safe to say that TikTok is changing the general music industry in Africa, and all over the world." Amapiano artist Xavier's song I Don't Know is another song that has sparked a viral global phenomenon. The song has had users create funny memes using the catchy lyric "I don't know if I know but I think I know I don't know".
