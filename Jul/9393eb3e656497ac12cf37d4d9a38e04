Xolani Mkayi, who  looked like he had been severely beaten, appeared briefly in the Uitenhage magistrate’s court on Tuesday  morning on a murder charge. Mkayi  is accused of fatally shooting his ex-wife, Phumeza Pepeta, while she was attending her father’s funeral at the Matanzima Cemetery on Sunday. The 55-year-old staggered into court on Monday and asked that he be allowed to see a doctor. Pepeta was rushed to hospital after she was shot, but  later died of  her injuries. On Monday police spokesperson Captain Gerda Swart said  Mkayi was arrested on the scene and a firearm was seized. His formal bail hearing will be on August 4. Mkayi will remain in custody until then. — HeraldLIVE
