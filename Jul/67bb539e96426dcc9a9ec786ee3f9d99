Finland's Valtteri Bottas drove his Mercedes to victory in the coronavirus-delayed season-opening Formula One Grand Prix in Austria on Sunday. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was second in an action-packed race, which saw 14 of the 20 drivers take a knee on the grid in an anti-racism stance. Lando Norris, in a McLaren, secured a first-ever podium finish in third, ahead of world champion and fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton in the second Mercedes.
