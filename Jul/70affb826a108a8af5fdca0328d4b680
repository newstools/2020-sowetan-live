No one predict what will happen in the future when it comes to accidents, whether they happen on the road or at home. During the Sowetan Dialogue presented in association with Budget Insurance on June 24, award-winning financial journalist and author, Maya Fisher-French, spoke about the value of maintaining your insurance cover particularly during uncertain times, pointing out that only 30% of drivers in SA are insured. Fisher-French said that too often South Africans regard insurance cover as a luxury, with many cancelling their policies during lockdown. This was despite insurance companies such as Budget Insurance coming to the party by offering premium reductions. “It is not valid that you don’t need insurance during lockdown. If you can’t afford your insurance, at least have third-party cover. It is also a lot cheaper to have combined car and household insurance,” she said. Fisher-French also noted that poverty and growing unemployment as a result of the lockdown had seen an increase in the number of break-ins to cars and homes. During the first five weeks of lockdown people weren’t driving their vehicles, so car accidents were down. With the easing of lockdown restrictions, vehicle accident claims have started to increase, and car thefts and hijackings were now back to pre-lockdown levels. Fisher-French encourages people to shop around to get the best quotes for car and household insurance since every insurer prices differently. She also offered tips while highlighting some of the factors that can affect your premiums: This article was paid for by Budget Insurance.
