Visual social media planner Hooper HQ has released the top 100 Instagram 2020 rich list. It includes influencers in fitness, beauty, music and fashion among eight categories. Hooper has been keeping track of how much influencers and celebrities get paid per sponsored Instagram post for four years since 2017. In a blog post, the publication says there has been a drop in fees paid to influencers as brands continue to take a knock in sales due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It also said beauty guru and reality TV star Kylie Jenner fell to second on the list for the first time in two years. This is attributed to the controversy about her “self-made billionaire status”, from an article published by Forbes magazine in May. Here are five celebrities who made the list, and this is how much they make: Kylie Jenner The founder of Kylie Cosmetics gets a whooping $986,000 per post and has 186 million Instagram followers.
