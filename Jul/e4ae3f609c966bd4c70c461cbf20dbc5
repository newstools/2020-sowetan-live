The small semi-rural community of Nteke, west of Durban, has been left reeling after a man and his two sons were airlifted to hospital in a critical condition after they were allegedly poisoned. Police and paramedics descended upon the home on Monday, where neighbours gathered outside. ER24's Russel Meiring said paramedics arrived on the scene at approximately 11.20am to find the local authorities already in attendance. "On closer inspection, medics found a man and two boys lying motionless inside the home. Local authorities were able to gain access to the home, allowing paramedics to retrieve the patients and bring them to the awaiting ambulances," he said. "Once outside, medics assessed the patients and found that the man and two boys ... were in a critical condition. Medics treated the patients and provided them with advanced life support interventions before they were airlifted by a military medical helicopter to Albert Luthuli Hospital for further care." A neighbour said they had "never seen anything like it". "This is something you see on TV ... As mothers this is very traumatising for us. We don’t think we will even be able to eat,” she said. A relative told SowetanLIVE's sister publication TimesLIVE there was a history of domestic disputes in the family. Police were not immediately available for comment.
