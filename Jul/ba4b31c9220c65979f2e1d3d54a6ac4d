"It is alleged that the late principal a Mr ML Madonsela was shot at by a hail of bullets on Friday afternoon around 1pm just one kilometre from the school by unknown gunmen and the motive for killing is also not known at this point . "We are calling on anyone that may have information to contact the local police station," Mahlambi said.

"We are working with police to bring the perpetrators to book. We call for calm at this point in time and allow the police to do their work.
