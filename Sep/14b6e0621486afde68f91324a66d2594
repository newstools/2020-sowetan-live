He was later promoted and appointed as a personal staff officer to the former SANDF chief, Gen Siphiwe Nyanda. He was later transferred and appointed director covert collection before being promoted to chief director counter intelligence, a position he held until he was appointed general officer commanding training command and responsible for all training institutions of the SANDF military.
