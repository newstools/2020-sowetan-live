The SA entertainment industry is much closer than you'd think.  It's more like a family business. Some local celebrities are well known for their famous family members. Take Tebogo “Pinky Girl” Mekgwe, for example, who starred on the reality show Being Bonang with her cousin, TV personality Bonang Matheba. Some, however, are truly mind-blowing to learn, like comedian Trevor Gumbi and one-half of the Kings of the Weekend, DJ Sphectacula. The two are brothers and Gumbi is the oldest. Here some of SA's famous people and those to whom they are related. Bonang and Pinky Girl — cousins Lasizwe and Khanyi Mbau — brother and sister Anele Mdoda and Thembisa Nxumalo — sisters Nomzamo and Zamani Mbatha — brother and sister Boity and Thickleeyonce — cousins Natasha Thahane and Archbishop Desmond Tutu — grandfather and granddaughter Trevor Gumbi and DJ Sphectacula — brothers Maps and Marks Maponyane — father and son
