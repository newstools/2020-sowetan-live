SA women are fiercely strong and deeply and authentically rooted in their SA heritage. Most importantly, we celebrate our natural and diverse beauty through self-expression. Woolworths has once again joined forces with Sir John to collaborate on an exclusive, limited-edition make-up range within the W.Beauty brand in a collection inspired by and made for SA women. From concept and art direction to the formulas themselves, Sir John and W.Beauty sought to honour the wave of women reigning and shining, and aptly named the collection “Reign & Shine”. Join Sowetan S Mag editor Thembalethu Zulu in conversation with world-renowned global make-up artist Sir John, Idols judge, author, and media personality Unathi Nkayi, and S Mag beauty editor Nokubonga Thusi, on the tools you need to harness the power of self expression and celebrate what makes us uniquely South African through the limited-edition range inspired by SA women and beauty.
