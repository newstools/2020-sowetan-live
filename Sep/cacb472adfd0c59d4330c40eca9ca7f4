Tshegofatso Pule’s family is optimistic about getting justice  but  hope  the trial of Muzikayise Malephane  will provide  answers to all their  questions. “For now we are taking one day at a time and will wait until  the trial begins to hear why he [allegedly] did this and if he did this alone,” Pule’s uncle Tumisang Katake told SowetanLIVE's sister publication TimesLIVE. Katake said the family hoped the investigation into Pule’s murder would  reveal the motive for her killing. “We  hope the trial will reveal what really happened,” he said. Pule, who was heavily pregnant, was found murdered and  hanging from a tree at Durban Deep, Roodepoort, in June. Katake previously told the media that though the family was  in pain, they were ready to hear how Pule died. “We are preparing ourselves for a difficult journey  of having to relive the last moments of Tshegofatso — her last moments on earth. But it’s a journey we as the family are prepared to travel, especially if we want to get  justice for Tshegofatso Pule,” he said. Malephane’s last court appearance was in July at the Roodepoort magistrate’s court and the case was postponed to September 29 for further investigation. The NPA said the state had requested that he appear last week and his case was transferred to the high court for a pretrial hearing on September 15.
