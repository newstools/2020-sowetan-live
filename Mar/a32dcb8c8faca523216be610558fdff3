On Friday, 27 March 2020 South Africans woke up to day one of the 21 day lockdown. The nationwide lockdown is one of the measures announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa to halt the spread of the coronavirus. While this is not a pleasant time for all involved, South Africans all over are finding ways to make the best of the situation. We would like you to tell us your lockdown stories. Have you started an exercise routine? Are you trying out new cooking/baking recipes or have you finally started reading those books you never had time for? Are you working from home? Let us know and share some tips with fellow readers on how to beat the boredom. Oh and tips on how to keep the kids busy during this time are welcome as well.
