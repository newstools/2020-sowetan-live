An 11-year-old girl, who was reported missing in Dengeza, outside Giyani, on Monday, was found murdered and dismembered on Tuesday, said Limpopo police. Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said the child was found dumped at the Klein Letaba dam. “The discovery was made by community members, who called the police. The police retrieved the body and discovered that some of her body parts were missing,” said Mojapelo. “The motive for this murder is unknown, but ritual murder cannot be ruled out,” he added. Provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba condemned the brutal killing of the child and called on police to hunt down her killers.
