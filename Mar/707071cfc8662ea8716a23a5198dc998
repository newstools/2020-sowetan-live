South Africa will again have two spots in each of the annual African club competitions next season after the exploits of Bidvest Wits and Mamelodi Sundowns this campaign‚ according to the Confederation of African Football (Caf). Sundowns reached the quarterfinals of the Caf Champions League before bowing out to Egypt’s Al Ahly earlier this month while Wits competed in the group phase of the Caf Confederation Cup for the first time. Sundowns contributed three points and Wits 0.5 points to the five-year coefficient‚ where the country’s achievements in the two competitions over the five-year period are awarded points‚ given a weighting and then averaged out.
