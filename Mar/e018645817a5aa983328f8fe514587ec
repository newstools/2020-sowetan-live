France international Eliaquim Mangala said that he is one of the five players and staff of La Liga side Valencia who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The 29-year-old's team mate Ezequiel Garay on Sunday became the first La Liga player to contract the virus that has affected a host of global sports events. "I knew today that I am #coronavirus positive," Mangala said on Twitter. "I'm feeling good and I have no symptoms associated with the virus. However, I am confined in house and separated from my family. "I learned we can carry the virus without having symptoms, that's why I recommend everyone to follow confinement measures and avoid contact with other people, as much as possible, even if you feel well." Valencia had travelled to Milan last month for a Champions League match against Atalanta, which was played in front of a packed San Siro stadium, before restrictions were placed on sports events in Italy -- the country in Europe worst hit by the coronavirus. All organised soccer in Spain has been postponed for at least two weeks to prevent the spread of the virus.
