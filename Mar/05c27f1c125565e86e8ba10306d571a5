Don't let their size fool you: thick, natural-looking individual Marley Kinky is usually light, plus you can go for the solid type of a Marley twist variation. There are various ways to accessorise your faux locs. Cowrie shells are an excellent way to upgrade your style. The shaded porcelain shells pair well with locs and look even better when combined with gold accessories. Coils and cuffs add a bit of shine to the entire faux loc look. Another way to take your faux locs to goddess levels is with a single metallic thread. Alternatively, yarn can be used to give your look a boho effect. With faux locs, you have a world of possibilities once you pick the right type for you and your lifestyle.
