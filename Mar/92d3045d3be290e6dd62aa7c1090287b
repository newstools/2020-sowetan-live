Restaurants and food delivery services will not be operational during the lockdown. This was announced by the ministry of tourism yesterday after President Cyril Ramaphosa revealed stringent measures in an effort to curb the spread of the highly infectious and deadly Covid-19. Ramaphosa said from tomorrow midnight, a nation-wide lockdown would be enforced for 21 days. The country has been on state of disaster that has seen drinking holes operating 9am until 6pm from Monday to Saturday, and from 9am until 1pm on Sundays and public holidays. In addition, public gatherings were limited to 100 people. "In compliance with the nation-wide lockdown it should be noted that all restaurants, cafes, bars, coffee shops will be required to comply with the nation-wide lockdown for 21 days," said the media statement released yesterday. "Such service providers have not been included on the list of what has been deemed essential services during the lockdown, will not be permitted to operate, and will thus need to be closed for the duration." The announcement came after the number of people infected with coronavirus reached 554 yesterday. "In addition, in compliance with the nation-wide lockdown, all food delivery services will also need to be suspended for 21 days with effect from midnight Thursday, March 26 until midnight Thursday, April 16."
