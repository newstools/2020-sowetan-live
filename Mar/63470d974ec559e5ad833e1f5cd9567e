On Saturday, health minister Zweli Mkhize held an urgent meeting with the national health council, including MECs and HODs for health of the provinces. “The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the latest situational analysis of each province as more Covid-19 cases are being confirmed. In our engagement, it became clear that the role played by contact tracers is very important and their capacity needs to be strengthened,” said the health ministry. “The NHC agreed that in order to minimise the risk of further spread of the virus, contact tracing must be done within 48 hours.”
