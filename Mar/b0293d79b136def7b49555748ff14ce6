Hotel magnate Sol Kerzner is still alive but “gravely ill”. Several social media platforms claimed that Kerzner — founder and chair of Kerzner International Holdings Ltd and Sun International — had died on Saturday. However a spokesperson for Kerzner, Ian Douglas, told SowetanLIVE's sister publication TimesLIVE from London that despite his severe ill-health, Kerzner “is still alive”. “He is very ill, but it's not true that he has died.” It is understood that Kerzner has been battling a terminal illness.
